# Elm Springs

> I plan to release it to packages.elm-lang.org soon. I'd like some feedback first. Will people find it useful?

A rough model of a mass attached to a spring, as described by [Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law). Good for making smooth and organic looking animations or modelling oscillating values (e.g. emotions). High physical accuracy is not a priority - performance and API simplicity is more important.
